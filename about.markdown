Hey, I'm Bill. I am a technologist with a penchant for data products and natural language processing.

I recently worked to prevent a Trump re-election at [Hawkfish](https://www.hawkfish.us/){:target="_blank"}. Before that I helped build new approaches to value-based care for underserved communities at [Cityblock](https://www.cityblock.com/){:target="_blank"}. I studied Computer Science and Sociology at Columbia University, and Arabic at DLI.

I use the pronouns he, him, and his.
